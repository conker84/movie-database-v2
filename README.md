# movie-database-v2
This is a small application using **Node.js**, **Express** and **MongoDB**, as well as some experience with **Socket.io**. The application is a movie datadabase that stores information from movies and movie stars. In this current version, you can see a list of movies, see the movie details, edit and update the movie details, delete a movie from the list and search through movies. The same for the actors and actresses.

## Running the app ##
I suppose you already have a Node.js version installed, as well as MongoDB. In order to run the app, you should open 3 tabs on Terminal and run these commands:

### Tab 1
<pre> mongod --dbpath data</pre>

### Tab 2
<pre>mongo</pre>

### Tab 3
<pre>npm start</pre>

The app now should be running at **http://localhost:3000**

It's a small project, but I hope you enjoy it.
